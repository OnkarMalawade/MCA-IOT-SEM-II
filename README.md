## Servo Motor

<p>A servo motor is a special kind of electric motor designed to enable precise and accurate movement. It is commonly used in applications such as robots or machines. A servo motor is like a smart motor because it can control its position, speed, and power. This motor works with a sensor that tells it where it is, and a controller makes sure it moves the way we want it to. People use these motors a lot in big machines, especially in places like factories where we need things to move very accurately and smoothly. This article discusses servo motors, and their importance in various fields such as robotics and manufacturing, explaining how they work, how they’re built, and where they are commonly used.

Servo motors are like powerful little engines with a high torque-to-inertia ratio, meaning they can generate a lot of twisting force relative to their size and weight. This makes them perfect for tasks that need quick acceleration, deceleration, and precise movements. They come in various sizes and power levels to suit different jobs and can be powered by either AC or DC voltage. What’s good is that we can control their speed and force using special signals called pulse width modulation (PWM). Some servo motors have extra features like built-in controllers and communication interfaces, which makes them adaptable and easy to integrate into complex systems.</p>

## DC Motor

<p>DC motor is a machine that converts electrical energy of direct current into mechanical energy. In a DC motor, the input electrical energy is direct current which is converted into mechanical rotation.</p>

> DC Motor is an electrical machine which, when provided with direct current electrical energy, converts it into mechanical energy. It is based on electromagnetic induction, where a conductor carrying current (normally a coil of wire) placed in a magnetic field experiences force to rotate. This rotation is used to perform mechanical work.

> There are many applications for DC motors, they can be used in robotics; electric vehicles, and some industrial machinery as well as household devices. DC motor can be used at such places where speed control is required. That is why DC motors are often used in trolleys, electric train production systems, elevators, etc.
