###Passive infrared sensor (PIR Sensor)
A passive infrared sensor:

A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view.

They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors.

PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications

PIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved. 
For that purpose, an imaging IR sensor is required.

PIR sensors are commonly called simply "PIR", or sometimes "PID", for "passive infrared detector". 

The term passive refers to the fact that PIR devices do not radiate energy for detection purposes. 

They work entirely by detecting infrared radiation (radiant heat) emitted by or reflected from objects.


###Ultrasonic Sensor:
Ultrasonic sensing is one of the best ways to sense proximity and detect levels with high reliability.

Our technical support gets emails all of the time about how our sensors work and what environments our sensors work (or don’t work) in.

This guide was created as an introduction to ultrasonic sensing, its principles, and how ultrasonic sensors work in your applications.

An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.

An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object’s proximity.

High-frequency sound waves reflect across boundaries to produce distinct echo patterns.

Application of Ultrasonic Sensor:

Ultrasound can be used for measuring wind speed and direction (anemometer), tank or channel fluid level, and speed through air or water.
For measuring speed or direction, a device uses multiple detectors and calculates the speed from the relative distances to particulates in the air or water. 
To measure tank or channel liquid level, and also sea level (tide gauge), the sensor measures the distance (ranging) to the surface of the fluid.
Further applications include: humidifiers, sonar, medical ultrasonography, burglar alarms and non-destructive testing.

Systems typically use a transducer that generates sound waves in the ultrasonic range, above 18 kHz, by turning electrical energy into sound,
then upon receiving the echo turn the sound waves into electrical energy which can be measured and displayed.

This technology, as well, can detect approaching objects and track their positions.[2]

Ultrasound can also be used to make point-to-point distance measurements by transmitting and receiving discrete bursts of ultrasound between transducers. 
This technique is known as Sonomicrometry where the transit-time of the ultrasound signal is measured electronically (ie digitally) and converted mathematically to the distance between transducers assuming the speed of sound of the medium between the transducers is known. 
This method can be very precise in terms of temporal and spatial resolution because the time-of-flight measurement can be derived from tracking the same incident (received) waveform either by reference level or zero crossing. 
This enables the measurement resolution to far exceed the wavelength of the sound frequency generated by the transducers.[1]
